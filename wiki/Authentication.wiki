Authentication got a lot easier with version 2.0 of the Android SDK.  Use the [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html AccountManager] to get the authentication token, and then pass it to the !GoogleTransport:

{{{
  GoogleTransport transport = new GoogleTransport("google-picasaandroidsample-1.0");
  AccountManager manager = AccountManager.get(this);
  String authToken = manager.blockingGetAuthToken(account, Picasa.AUTH_TOKEN_TYPE, true);
  transport.setGoogleLoginAuthorizationHeader(authToken);
}}}
