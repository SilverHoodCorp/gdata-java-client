#summary Experimental GData Java Client Version 2.

= Introduction =

We are experimenting with a new version 2 model for the GData Java Client.  It will have all of the functionality of version 1 of the client library (including Atom XML), plus these new features:
  * Much better experience on Android: much smaller library, and much more efficient
  * Native support for the new JSON-C wire format
  * User-defined object models
  * And we have some more surprises planned for the future that just won't be possible to do in the version 1 library

*WARNING:* this is an experimental branch of the library, and as such all API is subject to change.
