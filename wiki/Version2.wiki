*WARNING:* this is an experimental branch of the library, and as such the client library API is subject to change.  There are known bugs, and important features not yet implemented.  We invite you to experiment with this library and provide us with early feedback.

*WARNING:* this is a complete rewrite compared to version 1 of the library that uses completely different package names from version 1.  While it is not backwards compatible with version 1, it can be used in conjunction with version 1.  We are yet deprecating version 1 at this point.
