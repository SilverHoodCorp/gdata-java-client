#summary Experimental GData Java Client Version 2 Alpha.
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

We are experimenting with version 2 of the GData Java Client that will eventually replace the current version 1.  It features:
  * _(New in version 2.1!)_ Support for partial response/update
  * User-defined data models
  * Support for JSON-C wire format _(not supported in version 1 library)_
  * Support for Android: smaller and more efficient library _(not supported in version 1 library)_

For details, see these reference guides:
  * [UserDefinedObjectModelsXml User-Defined Partial Data Models in XML]
  * [UserDefinedObjectModels User-Defined Partial Data Models in JSON]
  * [Authentication Authentication]

There are some features not yet implemented in version 2 that we are working on now that are available in version 1, including:
  * Support for [http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/auth/oauth.html OAuth 1.0a authorization]
  * Support for [http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol_resumable_uploads.html resumable upload]

If you encounter a problem with this client library or want to request a feature, please [http://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/issues/entry submit an issue].

*WARNING:* this is an experimental branch of the library, and as such the client library API is subject to change.  There are known bugs, and important features not yet implemented.  We invite you to experiment with this library and provide us with early feedback.

*WARNING:* this is a complete rewrite compared to version 1 of the library that uses completely different package names from version 1.  While it is not backwards compatible with version 1, it can be used in conjunction with version 1.  We are yet deprecating version 1 at this point.
