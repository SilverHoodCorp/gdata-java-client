, but only keeping the stuff we actually need.

<p>The goal is to eventually have an explicit dependency on guava-libraries,
but also package this miniature version of guava-libraries to better support
low-space environments like Android.</p>

<p><b>Warning: this package is experimental, and its content may be
changed in incompatible ways or possibly entirely removed in a future version of
the library</b></p>

@since 2.3
